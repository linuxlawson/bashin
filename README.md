## bashin  

Password prompt to access linux terminal  (just for looks, doesn't actually prevent anything).  

place code in .bashrc file    

Current password = pencil (change to whatever).  
Username/greeting can be commented out if not needed/wanted.  

-------------------------------------------------------------  
  
  
## bashout   
Same thing but terminal will close (exit) after two failed password attempts.  


This only works when code is placed in .bashrc
