# bashpass
Password prompt to access terminal (just for looks, doesn't actually stop anything).  

place code in .bashrc file    

current password = pencil (change accordingly)  
comment out username/greeting if not needed


Note: 'exit' command can be placed after 2nd failed password attempt in order to close (exit) terminal.  
Makes a little more realistic, and how you want it to be anyway (exits terminal) right?  

i.e.      
else  
echo "Goodbye"  
sleep 2  
exit  

Only works in/from .bashrc
