# bashpass  

bashin -    
Password prompt to enter terminal - (just for looks, doesn't actually prevent anything).  

to be placed in .bashrc file    

Current password = pencil (change to whatever).  
Username/greeting can be commented out if not needed/wanted.  

==============================================  
  
  
bashout -  
Same as above but terminal will close (exit) after two failed password attempts.  


This only works in/from .bashrc
