# bashpass
Password prompt to access terminal (just for looks, doesn't actually prevent anything).  

to be placed in .bashrc file    

Current password = pencil (change to whatever).  
Comment out username/greeting if not needed/wanted.  

==============================================  
  
  
Note: 'exit' command can be placed after 2nd failed password attempt in order to close (exit) terminal.  

i.e.      
else  
echo "Goodbye"  
sleep 2  
exit  

This only works in/from .bashrc
